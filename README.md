# Ping-Pong Game
A game programmed in C++ that runs on the principles of a pingpong game.

# Motivation
This game is quite similar to the classic ping pong game from the 80s. I was inspired from the ideal gas assignment, while working on the collisions of particles. I really enjoyed working on a game like pong, where not only was I able customise the situation but also play against the computer.
