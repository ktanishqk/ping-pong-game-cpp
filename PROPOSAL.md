I would be working on a project that builds a pong game, much like the classic one from the 80s.
I was inspired from the ideal gas assignment, while working on the collisions of particles. 
I would really enjoy working on a game like pong, where not only can I customise the situation but also play against the computer.

Week 1: Work on building a comp vs comp game with pre-defined paddles, ball size, etc. \
Week 2: Work on building functionality for comp vs person game with functionality for 
different paddle sizes, ball size, etc. \
Week 3: Work on building functionality for person vs person using keyboard for one player and the mouse/trackpad for the other.

Extra functionality: change the color of the ball with every hit.
