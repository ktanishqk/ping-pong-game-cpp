I would be working on a project that builds a pong game, much like the classic one from the 80s. I was inspired from the ideal gas assignment, while working on the collisions of particles. I would really enjoy working on a game like pong, where not only can I customise the situation but also play against the computer.

Week 1: Work on building functionality for person vs person using keyboard for one player and the mouse/trackpad for the other with pre-defined paddles, ball size, etc.

Week 2: Work on building functionality for person vs person game with functionality for collisions, and taking key inputs alongside fixing bugs from Week 1.

Week 3: Work on building a comp vs person game (working on collision, automatic movement of paddles) with a leaderboard that supports both people and computer players.

Extra functionality: change the color of the ball and the paddle with every hit.
